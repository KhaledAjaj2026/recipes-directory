    <p>This dish is a classic, meaning everyone should know how to make it. What's that? You don't know how to cook it?
        What are you, one of those brats that live off of Uber Eats their entire lives, and can't even boil an egg?
        Kidding! This is why we made this why we made this recipe to begin with!
    </p>

    <p>Tomato Soup is perfect when coupled with our <a href="../parker-house-roll/parker-house-rolls.html">Parker House
            Rolls</a>, soft and
        fluffy to pick up all that tart goodness hidden
        within our red concoction. That recipe can be found in the main menu. But first, let's learn to make this
        dish.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>20 ounces cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>1 carrot, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch thick sticks</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, peeled</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cream</li>
        <li>basil leaves for garnish</li>
        <li>thyme sprigs for garnish</li>
        <li>crushed red pepper flakes for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with foil.</li>
        <li>Spread vegetables out on the prepared pan. Drizzle with olive oil; toss to coat. Sprinkle salt and Italian
            seasoning evenly over vegetables.</li>
        <li>Roast vegetables in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fill a high powered blender (such as a Vitamix) halfway with roasted vegetables and any accumulated juices.
            Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend, about 45 seconds.
            Pour into a saucepan. Repeat with remaining roasted vegetables.</li>
        <li>Pour water into the soup; add cream. Stir to combine and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Taste
            and adjust seasonings.</li>
        <li>Ladle into soup bowls. Garnish with basil and thyme, and sprinkle with crushed red pepper flakes if desired.
            Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
