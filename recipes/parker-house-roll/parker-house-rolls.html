    <p>This dish is a classic, meaning everyone should know how to make it. What's that? You don't know how to cook it?
        What are you, one of those brats that live off of Uber Eats their entire lives, and can't even boil an egg?
        Kidding! This is why we made this why we made this recipe to begin with!
    </p>

    <p>Parker House Rolls are the perfect companion of delicious <a href="../tomato-soup/tomato-soup.html">Tomato
            Soup</a>, whose
        recipe can be found on our site. It's red deliciousness is just asking to be dipped in with a soft roll of
        homemade bread.
