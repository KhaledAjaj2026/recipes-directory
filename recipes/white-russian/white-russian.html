    <p>This drink is a classic, meaning everyone should know how to make it. What's that? You don't know how to cook it?
        What are you, one of those brats that live off of Uber Eats their entire lives, and can't even boil an egg?
        Kidding! This is why we made this why we made this recipe to begin with!
    </p>

    <p>Everyone knows the classic, choice drink of The Dude, or Mr. Lebowski, no the other Lebowski the dead-beat one.
        While providing the spike that all beverages strive for this drink is eased by its added cream, and balanced
        with the coffee liquor which gives it its signature taste and aroma.
